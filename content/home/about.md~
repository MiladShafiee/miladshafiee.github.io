# Biography
My name is Andrea Del Prete. I am a robotics researcher focusing on the use of optimization algorithms for control, planning and estimation of legged robots. Since 2017 I am a lead of dynamic and control group of SURENA 4 humanoid robot project  in the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies(CAST) at University of Tehran, where I work with the humanoid robot SURENA 3 and Mini-SURENA. Here I am mainly collaborating with Nicolas Mansard, Olivier Stasse, Steve Tonneau and Justin Carpentier.

Before coming to LAAS I have spent four years (3 of PhD + 1 of post-doc) at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT, Genova, Italy), where I have worked with Lorenzo Natale and Francesco Nori on the iCub humanoid robot.

In 2013 I also started a fruitful collaboration with Michele Focchi, an IIT researcher working with the Hydraulic Quadruped HyQ.
Lena Smith is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. Her research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. She leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
